Shop Billing System is based on the concept of generating the total bill of a shopâ€™s transaction. The user can generate 
a total bill of an item by entering the number of items, name, quantity, and price per item. After all this, the system 
generates a total amount with adding Taxes and asks for the amount paid and displays the total return amount to 
the user. The shop Billing system is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, strings 
have been used for the development of it. This project provides the simplest system for management of shop billings.
